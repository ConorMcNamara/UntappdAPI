# UntappdAPI

Includes basic support for accessing Untappd's API v4 through Python.


The main file, UntappdAPI, includes basic support for accessing and doing basic searches like for the beer name or brewery.

The rest of the files provide support for more specific actions, such as accepting or declining friend requests, doing beer checkins or getting feed information from a certain bar or brewery.

Note that, given this is through Untappd's API, things can break at any point.
